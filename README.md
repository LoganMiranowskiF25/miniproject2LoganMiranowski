Tracking the percentage (out of 200 sample size) of customers who have a streaming service subscription
 
## Description
 
The goal of this project is to track the percentage of people who have a streaming service
subscription. In my experience, fewer viewers attend movies in theaters. Instead, most viewers have become customers of streaming services, because of convenience, and cost efficiency. This project should not be treated as a source of accurate statisitics, as the data source itself may not be accurate. However, importing verified, relevant data to this project is an effective method to acquire accurate statistics.
